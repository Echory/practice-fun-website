            <h2>Lore</h2>
            <p>Witchcraft is the practice of what the practitioner ("witch") believes to be magical skills and abilities
                such as using spells, incantations, and magical rituals. Witchcraft is a broad term that varies
                culturally and societally, and thus can be difficult to define with precision.[1] Historically, the most
                common meaning is the use of supernatural means to cause harm to others; this remains the meaning in
                most traditional cultures worldwide, notably the Indigenous cultures of Africa and the African diaspora,
                Asia, Latin America, and Indigenous Nations in the Americas.[2][3][4][5]

                In the Philippines, as in many of these cultures, witches are viewed as those opposed to the sacred. In
                contrast, anthropologists writing about the healers in Indigenous Philippine folk religions either use
                the traditional terminology of these cultures, or broad anthropological terms like "shaman".[6]

                In the modern era, some now use "witchcraft" to also refer to benign, positive, or neutral metaphysical
                practices, such as those of modern Paganism;[7][8] examples of these practices may include divination,
                meditation, or self-help techniques. But this reversal in nomenclature is primarily a modern, Western
                phenomenon.[9]

                Belief in witchcraft is often present within societies and groups whose cultural framework includes a
                magical world view.[1]</p>

        <h2>Discover a Coven</h2>
        <p>In Wicca and other similar forms of neopagan witchcraft, such as Stregheria and Feri, a coven is a gathering
            or community of witches, like an affinity group, engagement group, or small covenant group. It is composed
            of a group of practitioners who gather together for rituals such as Drawing Down the Moon, or celebrating
            the Sabbats.[citation needed]. The place at which they generally meet is called a covenstead.[2]
